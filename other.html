  i enjoy playing sports
  video games
  and have a fasination of space
  i have always dreamed of making it to space one day
  its some thing i would give up anything for 
  just at a chance to become an astronaut 
  its my passion and the one thing in life i wish i put more effort into 
  but instead i just watch many sci-fi related things and read up about anything outer plant related.
