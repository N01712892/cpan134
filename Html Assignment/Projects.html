<figcaption>These are one of the NASA rovers that I have worked on, it was one of the new rovers to be creaded this year. The purpose behind these guys is to explore the surfaces of 
    different planets to document their geography and look for new habitable planets for human life. The development of this machine took myself and fellow engineers multiple years to perfect the design
    in order for it to be effiecent on a mullitude of terrians.
